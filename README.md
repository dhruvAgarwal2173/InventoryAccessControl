This project assumes the identity of the the user is defined by using a RFID card and the inventory is segregated in multiple lockers.

## Hardware Used

  - Arduino Uno (with a cable, duh)
  
  - MRC522 RFID reader
  
  - RFID tags/ cards
  
  - Perf board (You can use a breadboard for prototyping)
  
  - Single Strand Wires
  
  
  ### Optional
    
   - LCD module
